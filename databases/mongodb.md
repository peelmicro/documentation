# Introduction

[MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB) is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. It is issued under the Server Side Public License (SSPL) version 1, which was submitted for OSI certification but later withdrawn in lieu of SSPL version 2. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemata. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc.
